# Measuring and Assessing Open Source Project Impact and Community Health

Open source software (OSS) projects are increasingly interested in tracking the impact of their packages and the health of their communities. The motivation to measure these attributes comes from both internal needs and external demands: Internally, project leaders use these measurements to set development roadmaps, make strategic decisions about resource allocation, and ensure that they are providing a welcoming, productive environment for contributors and users. Externally, projects use impact and health measurements to raise funds, report to funders, market their tools, and support career development for people who have contributed.
